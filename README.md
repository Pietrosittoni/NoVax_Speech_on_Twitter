This study takes a closer look at the public discussion that emerged in the online world in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. By analyzing Twitter debates from the period of March 2020 to May 2022, the authors aim to comprehend how the public discourse evolved throughout the most critical phases of the pandemic. 

To achieve this goal, the authors use a combination of Network Science and text analysis tools. 
The Network Science approach involves constructing a graph representation of the tweets, where hashtags serve as nodes, to uncover the relationships between them. In addition, the authors employ LIWC software to perform a semantic analysis of the tweets, which enables them to examine the underlying meanings and sentiments expressed in the discourse.

The study provides a comprehensive examination of the online discussion by combining both technical and semantic analyses. 
The findings from the network analysis provide a bird's eye view of the structure of the conversation, while the semantic analysis delves deeper into the content of the tweets. 
This combination of approaches provides a robust and thorough understanding of the public debate during the Covid-19 pandemic.
